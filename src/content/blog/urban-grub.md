In the vibrant tapestry that is 12 South, Urban Grub emerges not just as a restaurant, but as a statement—a declaration of love for food that is both grounded in tradition and teeming with innovation.

The moment you step in, the juxtaposition is evident. Urban yet rustic. Modern yet traditional. It's like stepping into a culinary theater where every dish is a performance, a narrative.

First, the Urban andouille—a spicy, smoky delight. But this isn't just about the sausage. It's the dance of flavors that follows: the tang of goat cheese, the rich allure of blue cheese, each complementing the other, challenging and yet, harmonizing.

But the pièce de résistance? The 12oz dry-aged bone-in filet. This isn’t just meat; this is art. Each bite is a lesson in patience, in the beauty of the aging process. The tender, flavorful steak bears the marks of time, of careful nurturing. It's a testament to the craft, to the sheer respect for produce.

Accompanying the steak, the ham hock collared greens take you on a journey down South—a nostalgic nod to classic Southern fare, but with that unmistakable Urban Grub twist.

Yet, what truly elevates this meal is the Malbec Salentein Reserve. This wine doesn't just accompany; it converses. Deep, with notes of dark fruits and a hint of chocolate, it weaves effortlessly with the flavors on the plate, enhancing, enriching.

Urban Grub is not just a meal; it's an experience. A love letter to the roots, to the very essence of cooking, yet with a gaze firmly set on the future. To evenings in 12 South, where tradition meets innovation, and every bite tells a story. Cheers to the dance of flavors and to nights that linger in memory long after the plates are cleared.
