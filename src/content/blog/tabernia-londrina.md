Amidst Lisbon's undulating streets, where ancient tram tracks wind past pastel-colored buildings and the distant croon of Fado lingers, there's a spot where Porto's culinary gem has found a home. Taberna Londrina, while nestled in Lisbon's heart, pulses with the soul of northern Portugal.

Gathering with colleagues for lunch here feels like a brief sojourn to the vibrant streets of Porto. At the heart of this culinary journey is the Francesinha. A sandwich, yes, but not just any sandwich. This is a masterpiece of gastronomic excess. Layer upon layer of cured ham, linguiça, steak, occasionally punctuated by other meats, draped in a cascade of melted cheese and bathed in a spicy, rich tomato-beer sauce. Though the origins of Francesinha's sauce are cloaked in mystery and tightly-held secrets, each bite resonates with the fervor and warmth of the north.

The accompanying fries, golden and crisp, play more than just a side role. They're the perfect partners in this indulgent escapade, adept at soaking up the decadent sauce, providing textural contrast to the sandwich's oozy richness.

As the team dives into the meal, the ambiance of Taberna Londrina envelops you. The buzz of conversation, the clinking glasses, and the feeling of being transported to a taberna in Porto, even if just for an hour. It's in these moments, where work blurs into pleasure, that bonds are formed and memories etched.

To Taberna Londrina, for bridging the culinary gap between Lisbon and Porto, to the timeless allure of Lisbon, and to those lunches where work feels worlds away amidst shared plates and stories—Saúde!
